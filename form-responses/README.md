# form-responses

Indexer survey: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1zC4c4RUhhVzUKOAviBwa8mofMUeSs4-KStax32uUsiY/edit.

Write-up: https://hackmd.io/GI_gzqeZRme_p-GHue-UVQ.

Each `0xABCD.csv` file is the normalized response of a given indexer.

The `deployment-0xABCD.csv` is the result for querying the POH `subgraph_deployment` table, only one indexer sent this result.

> Note: indexer `0xb06071394531b63b0bac78f27e12dc2beaa913e4` data unfortunately didn't help much because the binary data wasn't sent :/
